# FermView
This is a web portal to control and view data from an Arduino temperature controller connected via wifi. The inspiration for this 
project is that I am a homebrewer. When brewing beer, it is important to keep fermentation at consistent temperatures and, depending on style, 
the temperature needs to slowly change over time. When finished, this app will be able to set profiles based on different yeast strains and the
temperature controller will keep the fermentation chamber in the desired temperature range.
